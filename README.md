Due to the NDA agreement with Isfahan University, the code will be published once the result is announced and IAI lets us do so. <br>
But here is an example of model prediction.
![Ground_19](https://github.com/mrezaus/IAI_MS/assets/122408162/b673fddd-e068-4be6-84e3-05fdb3982c15)
<br>
![Pred_19](https://github.com/mrezaus/IAI_MS/assets/122408162/0390d3cc-8746-4eb3-b497-fb4b83ba0902)
<br>
The predicted and Ground truth, at first sight, might seem different, but if you focus, you will see the darker parts in the predicted are actually 1, and because the maximum number of that image is 3, they are dimmer than larger numbers.
